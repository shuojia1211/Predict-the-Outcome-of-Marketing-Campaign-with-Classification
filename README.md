# Metis-Project-3
The dataset I'm using is a very famous marketing campaign dataset(Bank Marketing Data Set from UCI machine learning repository) which targets on predicting if a client would purchage term of deposit if this person was contacted by the bank. Data features includes 3 parts: Demographic (including the age, education, occupation, loan, housing, balance,etc.), Info Related to Last Contact within Current Campaign, Other Info Related to Campaign(including some info of previous campaign), and Social/Economic Ratios(employment variation rate, consumer price index, etc.).

The classification methodologies I'm going to apply on my analysis are: logistic regression, decision tree, and support vector machine.
